      <p class="body1">I am a 27 year old American male who has travelled in Europe for the past 5-6 years of my life teaching and studying languages.
       I am currently studying computer programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more in order to find employment.
        Now that I am back in the United States, web development seems like a skill I can easily learn in a couple of years and sucesfully
        find myself good employment giving myself independence and a career I enjoy.
